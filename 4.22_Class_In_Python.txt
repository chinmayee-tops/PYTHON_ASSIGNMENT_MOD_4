>>> How to Define a Class in Python? What Is Self? Give An Example Of A Python Class. 

The class creates a user-defined data structure, which holds its own data members and member functions, 
which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A class is like a blueprint for an object.

Some points on Python class:

-Classes are created by keyword class.
-Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.
-Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator. Eg.: My class.Myattribute

The self is used to represent the instance of the class. With this keyword, you can access the attributes and 
methods of the class in python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments.
