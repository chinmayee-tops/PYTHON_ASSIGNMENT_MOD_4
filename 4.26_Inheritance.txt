>>>Explain Inheritance in Python with an example? What is init? Or What Is A Constructor In Python?

One of the core concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) languages is inheritance. It is a mechanism 
that allows you to create a hierarchy of classes that share a set of properties and methods by deriving a class 
from another class. Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. 

Example :
class Person(object):
   
 
  def __init__(self, name, id):
    self.name = name
    self.id = id
 
  
  def Display(self):
    print(self.name, self.id)
 
 

emp = Person("Chinmayee", 111) # An Object of Person
emp.Display()
